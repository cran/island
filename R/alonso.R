#' Lakshadweep Archipelago coral fish community reassembly
#'
#' A list with three datasets containing presence-absence data for the
#' reassembly proccess of coral fish communities in three atolls (Agatti, Kadmat
#' and Kavaratti) of the Lakshadweep Archipelago (India).
#'
#' Surveys were conducted from 2000 to 2011 in order to follow community
#' reassembly after a coral mass mortality event in the relatively unfished
#' Lakshadweep Archipelago.  Results indicated that higher trophic groups suffer
#' an increased extinction rate even without fishing targeting them.
#'
#' @format A list with 3 dataframes, each corresponding to the survey of a
#'   different atoll. Dataframes have in columns: \describe{ \item{Species}{Name
#'   of the species found} \item{Trophic.Level}{A number indicating the trophic
#'   level of the surveyed species} \item{Presence-absence data}{Several columns
#'   with letters (indicating the atoll surveyed) and the year in which the
#'   surveys were done} \item{Guild}{Guild of the surveyed species} }
#'
#' @note Kavaratti atoll was not surveyed in 2000 and 2010.
